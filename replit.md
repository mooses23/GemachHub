# Baby Banz Earmuffs Gemach

## Overview

This full-stack web application manages a global network of gemachs (lending libraries) for Baby Banz noise-cancelling earmuffs. Its primary purpose is to protect infants' hearing by facilitating the lending process, managing deposits, and providing administrative tools. The platform supports three user types: public users (borrowers, new gemach applicants), operators (manage specific gemach locations), and admins (system-wide oversight). The project aims to expand the availability of ear protection for infants worldwide by streamlining the lending and management process.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express
- **Language**: TypeScript (ESM modules)
- **API Pattern**: REST endpoints (`/api/`)
- **Authentication**: Passport.js (local strategy, session-based via express-session)
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL via connect-pg-simple
- **Modular Structure**: Specialized services for routes, data access, authentication, payment processing, email, and audit trails.

### Data Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Neon serverless driver)
- **Schema**: Shared between client/server (`shared/schema.ts`)
- **Key Entities**: Users, Regions, CityCategories, Locations, Transactions, Payments, PaymentMethods, GemachApplications, Contacts.

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control**: User, operator, admin roles.
- **Operator PIN-based Login**: Operators authenticate with location code + PIN, allowing session-based access to their specific location.
- **Invite Code System**: For user registration.

### Payment Processing
- **Unified Deposit System**: $20 refundable deposit model.
- **Multiple Payment Methods**: Supports Stripe, PayPal, cash, etc.
- **Cash Deposits Auto-Complete**: Cash is collected in person at borrow time, so cash payments are recorded as `completed` immediately (no admin/operator confirmation step). The legacy `/admin/payment-confirmations` page has been removed; that route now redirects to `/admin/transactions`. A startup backfill (`server/backfill-cash-payments.ts`) flips any leftover `confirming`/`pending` cash rows to `completed` and corrects their transaction's `depositPaymentMethod`.
- **Pay Later System**: Card verification without immediate charge via Stripe SetupIntents, charging only if items are damaged or not returned. This minimizes transaction fees for successful returns.
- **Refund System**: Role-based access control for processing full or partial refunds, aligned with deposit system.

### Operator Dashboard Features
- **Operator PIN Logic**: New/dynamic locations start with a null PIN treated as "1234" — both login and PIN-change routes normalise `null` to `"1234"` so operators can set a real PIN on first use.
- **Inventory Management**: Color-based tracking, low stock alerts, add stock functionality.
- **Lend Wizard**: Guided process for lending, including color selection, borrower info, and deposit handling.
- **Self-Deposit Acceptance**: Operators can accept self-deposits from customers who added their own card details. "Accept & Lend" button confirms lending without charging; status transitions from CARD_SETUP_COMPLETE to APPROVED.
- **Return Wizard**: Guided process for returns, including borrower selection and refund options (full/partial, damage deductions). Charge Card option is disabled if card setup was not completed (CARD_SETUP_PENDING status).

### Internationalization (i18n)
- **Languages**: English and Hebrew support (704 translation keys in both languages).
- **Translation System**: Custom hook-based (React Context) with translations in `client/src/lib/translations.ts`.
- **Usage**: Import `useLanguage` from `@/hooks/use-language` and use the `t()` function: `const { t, language, isHebrew } = useLanguage();`
- **RTL Support**: Automatic document direction switching when toggling to Hebrew.
- **Date Localization**: Use `formatLocalizedDate(date, language)` helper in operator dashboard for locale-aware date formatting.
- **Persistence**: Language preference saved in localStorage.
- **Verification Tool**: `scripts/verify-translations.js` - Automated script to verify translation key parity between English and Hebrew sections. Run with `node scripts/verify-translations.js` to check for missing translations.
- **Inbox Threading Test**: `scripts/test-inbox-threading.ts` - Regression test for the threaded admin inbox (subject normalization, list collapsing, atomic per-thread mutations, AI form-thread sibling selection). Run with `npx tsx scripts/test-inbox-threading.ts`. Exits non-zero on failure.
- **Startup Configuration Check**: `server/startup-checks.ts` runs at boot from `server/index.ts` and prints a unified config report — fallback notices for optional vars (SITE_URL, OPENAI_DRAFT_MODEL, OPENAI_EMBED_MODEL, ADMIN_EMAIL/GMAIL_USER, dev SESSION_SECRET), WARNING lines for production-critical vars that are missing (Stripe keys, OPENAI_API_KEY, APP_URL/SITE_URL), and a hard throw if truly required vars (DATABASE_URL, prod SESSION_SECRET, prod Stripe keys) are absent so misconfigured deploys fail fast. Also logs Twilio SMS/WhatsApp and Gmail status. Import-order invariant: every env-dependent module (routes, webhookHandlers, refund-reconciliation) is dynamically imported inside the IIFE in `server/index.ts` AFTER `runStartupChecks()` resolves, and `server/openai-client.ts` constructs the OpenAI SDK lazily via `getOpenAI()` for the same reason — adding a new env-dependent module at the top of `server/index.ts` would break this guarantee. Regression tests: `npx tsx scripts/test-startup-checks.ts` (pure validator) and `npx tsx scripts/test-startup-boot.ts` (spawns the real entry point and asserts the checker speaks before any low-level SDK crash).
- **Playwright e2e Suite**: `e2e/inbox-threading.spec.ts` and `e2e/inbox-filters.spec.ts` (config: `playwright.config.ts`) - Persistent UI regression tests that (a) verify the inbox collapses 3 sibling form messages into one row with a "{N} messages" pill, the transcript renders all messages, and marking the thread as spam moves every sibling atomically; and (b) verify thread-level search matches text from any message in the thread (not just the latest) while preserving the full message-count badge, and that the "Needs reply" / "Replied" filters correctly include/exclude un-replied threads. Run with `npx playwright test`. Uses system chromium; override with `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH` env var.
- **All Pages Covered**: Homepage, Rules, Contact, Apply, Self-Deposit, Admin Dashboard, Admin Locations, Admin Transactions, Admin Applications, Admin Emails, Admin Messages, Admin Payment Methods, Admin Payment Confirmations, Admin Payment Status Monitor, Operator Dashboard, Operator Login, Operator Deposit Dashboard.

### Visual Design System (Glassmorphism Theme)
- **Theme**: Dark glassmorphism with translucent panels and blur effects
- **Background**: Slate gradient (#0F172A to #1E293B)
- **Primary Color**: Ocean Blue (#3B82F6)
- **Accent Color**: Coral Orange (#F97316) for CTAs
- **Glass Effects**: Utility classes in `index.css` - `.glass-panel`, `.glass-card`, `.btn-glass-primary`, etc.
- **Ambient Effects**: Floating glow orbs (`.glow-orb-blue`, `.glow-orb-teal`, `.glow-orb-accent`)
- **Typography**: White (#F8FAFC) for headings, slate-300/400 for body text on dark backgrounds
- **Key Components Styled**: Header, homepage hero, location search, how-it-works cards, CTA section, dedication banner

### Contact Actions System
- **Component**: `client/src/components/ui/contact-actions.tsx` provides `ContactActions` (dark/glass theme, compact icon-only variant) and `ContactActionsLight` (light theme with labels)
- **Features**: Clickable phone numbers (`tel:` links), SMS with pre-filled message (`sms:` links), WhatsApp with pre-filled message (`wa.me` links)
- **Pre-filled Message**: Localized borrowing inquiry message with location name placeholder
- **Integration Points**: Location cards (hierarchical search + legacy cards), self-deposit borrower form (both form view and payment view)
- **Navigation Safety**: Cards use programmatic navigation via `useLocation` hook with click delegation to prevent contact button clicks from triggering card navigation
- **i18n**: Translation keys `callAction`, `smsAction`, `whatsappAction`, `prefillBorrowMessage`, `contactLocation`, `contactLocationPrompt`, `contactLabel2` in both EN and HE

## External Dependencies

### Payment Integrations
- **Stripe**: `@stripe/stripe-js`, `@stripe/react-stripe-js` (frontend); native Stripe SDK (backend).
- **PayPal**: `@paypal/paypal-server-sdk`.

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: `pg` Pool driver.
- **Drizzle ORM**: For database interactions.

### Email
- Email notification service structure exists (`server/email-notifications.ts`), ready for SMTP/email service integration.

### Admin Gmail Inbox & AI Responses
- **Gmail API**: `server/gmail-client.ts` for reading and sending emails (supports Replit connector and Vercel OAuth). Header values are CRLF-sanitized and recipient emails validated to prevent header injection.
- **OpenAI**: `server/openai-client.ts` returns `{ draft, classification, needsHumanReview, reviewReason }` using a built-in PLAYBOOK + DB context (sender → application/location). Inbox shows a "Human review recommended" banner when escalation triggers fire.
- Unified inbox at `/admin/inbox` merges Gmail + web-form contact messages.
- **Reply examples (training memory)**: Every admin reply is captured in `reply_examples` and indexed into `kb_embeddings` (sourceKind=`reply_example`) for semantic retrieval into future drafts. Admins can review and prune them on `/admin/glossary` under the **Replies** tab (sender, classification, language, "Edited by admin" / "Sent as drafted" flag, expand-to-see-bodies). Removing an example via `DELETE /api/admin/reply-examples/:id` also drops the matching `kb_embeddings` row so it stops biasing drafts.

### Operator Onboarding
- `POST /api/admin/locations/:id/send-welcome` and `POST /api/admin/locations/send-welcome-all` send a plaintext setup email (location code + default PIN `1234` + dashboard URL + "change PIN" instructions) via `sendOperatorWelcomeEmail` in `server/email-notifications.ts`.
- Dashboard URL prefers `APP_URL`/`SITE_URL` env, falls back to request host.
- Admin UI: per-row "Send setup email" + bulk "Send setup email to all" in PIN Management card on `/admin/locations`.
- `/operator/login` now renders `OperatorLogin` (was previously redirecting to `/auth`).

### Message Send History (Persistent Log)
- Every operator message send attempt (single or bulk) is permanently logged in the `message_send_logs` table (schema in `shared/schema.ts`).
- Each log entry records: locationId, locationName, locationCode, channel (sms/whatsapp/email), status (sent/failed/skipped), error reason, sentAt timestamp, sentByUserId, and a batchId (UUID shared by all sends in a bulk operation).
- The log is written in `server/operatorOnboardingService.ts` after each send attempt (including skipped pre-flight cases like no phone on file).
- Admin GET endpoint: `GET /api/admin/message-send-logs` (supports optional `locationId` and `limit` query params).
- Admin UI: A collapsible "Message Send History" card on `/admin/locations` below the location table. Shows a summary strip (sent/failed/skipped counts) and a full scrollable table with color-coded rows. Batch sends are visually grouped. Refreshes automatically every 10s when open, and invalidates on every send.
- Message compose textareas and preview blocks use `font-sans` instead of `font-mono` for proper Hebrew rendering.
### Cash Deposit Recording (Operator)
- `POST /api/cash-payment` is the canonical "record cash deposit" endpoint.
- Auth: Passport (admin or operator) **or** PIN session (operator). Borrowers and other Passport roles are rejected.
- `DepositService.initiateCashPayment(transactionId, locationId, actor)` validates: transaction exists, `transaction.locationId === locationId`, operator (non-admin) is scoped to that location. Operators with no `operatorLocationId` are rejected outright (no silent bypass).
- **Idempotent**: a duplicate call for a transaction that already has a completed cash payment returns the existing `paymentId` instead of creating a second row.
- **Race-safe**: an in-process `withCashLock(transactionId)` mutex (mirrors `withRefundLock`) serializes concurrent requests on the same transaction. (Single-process only — a multi-instance deploy needs a DB-level partial unique index for full safety.)
- Every successful call writes an `audit_logs` row (`action='cash_payment_recorded'`, `actorUserId`, `actorType`, `entityType='payment'`, `entityId=<paymentId>`, IP, role+amount in `afterJson`). Audit-write failures are logged but do not fail the request.
- `/api/deposits/initiate` (the public deposit-creation endpoint) is still public for the Stripe path, but its `cash` branch now requires operator/admin auth and goes through the same lock + service.
- Operator Deposit Dashboard (`/operator/deposits`) — the "Pending Confirmations" tab/card/bulk-confirm button were removed (cash auto-completes at borrow time, so nothing ever lingers in a confirming state). The dashboard now shows 3 overview cards and 2 tabs (Recent Activity default, Analytics).

### Operator Card Actions (Charge / Decline)
- `POST /api/operator/transactions/:id/charge` and `.../decline` use the shared `getOperatorLocationId(req)` helper so both Passport operators and PIN-session operators are accepted.
- Admin (`-1` from the helper) is normalized to `undefined` before being passed to `PayLaterService`, which lets admins act across all locations while operators remain scoped to their own.
- Non-admin/non-operator Passport users (e.g. borrowers) are rejected.

### Schema Drift Hardening (Task #175)
- `server/databaseStorage.ts` `ensureSchemaUpgrades()` wraps every `ALTER`/`CREATE` in a per-statement `safe()` helper; a single failure no longer aborts the rest or crashes cold start. `schemaUpgradesRun` only flips on full success so the next cold start retries.
- `server/startup-checks.ts` `runSchemaDriftCheck()` runs after `ensureSchemaUpgrades` (wired in `server/routes.ts`) and verifies every post-baseline column/table exists, logging `schema-drift: OK` on success or ERROR-level lines with the exact `ALTER`/`CREATE` to apply on drift. Never throws. Production-only; dev/test boots skip the check.

### Schema Snapshot Baseline (Task #177)
- `drizzle/schema-snapshot.sql` is the committed, replayable baseline of the live `public` schema. It is produced by `pg_dump --schema-only --no-owner --no-privileges --no-comments --schema=public` so it captures everything pg_dump captures: tables, columns + defaults, sequences (with `OWNED BY` for SERIALs), PKs, uniques, FKs, CHECKs, indexes, enums, views, functions, triggers, and extensions. Verified replayable: piping the file into an empty database with `psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1` recreates the full schema.
- `scripts/schema-snapshot.mjs` is the source of truth for snapshot generation. Modes: `--check` (default; exit 1 on drift, prints compact diff; `--verbose` for full unified diff), `--write` (rewrite the snapshot), `--print` (stdout). It shells out to pg_dump (16.x, matching the prod cluster) and runs `normalizeDump()` to strip the per-dump volatile bits (`-- Dumped from/by` headers, session-only `SET`/`set_config` lines, the `\restrict`/`\\unrestrict` random tokens emitted by pg_dump 16+, and `--` section banners) so the committed file diffs cleanly across runs. Type sidecar at `scripts/schema-snapshot.d.mts`.
- `server/schema-snapshot.ts` reuses the .mjs's `dumpSchema(databaseUrl)` + `normalizeDump()` inside the running server. `runSchemaSnapshotCheck()` returns the diff; `triggerSchemaSnapshotCheck()` also emails admin on drift via `gmail-client.sendNewEmail`. Admin email resolves via `ADMIN_EMAIL` > `GMAIL_USER` > `DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL` (same chain as the rest of the app).
- `startSchemaSnapshotCron()` runs in `server/index.ts` on listen — first check 5 min after boot, then every 7 days. Set `SCHEMA_SNAPSHOT_CRON_DISABLED=1` to skip in tests. NOTE: this in-process cron only fires for environments that boot through `server/index.ts` (Replit deployments, `npm run dev`); the Vercel deployment uses `api/index.ts` and never imports `server/index.ts`. The GitHub Actions workflow below is the production-grade scheduler for Vercel.
- `GET /api/admin/schema-snapshot/check` exposes the same check on demand. Auth: either logged-in admin OR `X-Cron-Secret` header matching `SCHEMA_SNAPSHOT_CRON_SECRET` env var (so an external scheduler can hit it). Returns `{ ok, baselineMissing, snapshotPath, changedLineCount, compactDiff, emailSentToAdmin }`. Requires `pg_dump` on PATH — only useful in environments that have it (see toolchain note below).
- `.github/workflows/schema-snapshot.yml` runs the same `--check` weekly (Mon 09:00 UTC) and on every PR that touches the snapshot, the schema, or the snapshot tooling. Installs `postgresql-client-16` on the runner so `pg_dump` is available. Reads `DATABASE_URL` from the `SCHEMA_SNAPSHOT_DATABASE_URL` repo secret (configure with a read-only role pointing at prod). Workflow failure = drift; the compact diff is printed in the run log and surfaces via GitHub's normal failure notifications.
- Toolchain: `replit.nix` pins `pkgs.postgresql_16` so `pg_dump` is on PATH for dev and Replit deployments. The Vercel runtime does not have `pg_dump`, which is why drift detection on Vercel runs through the GHA workflow rather than the in-process cron.
- After any intentional schema change (new column in `ensureSchemaUpgrades`, etc.), regenerate with `node scripts/schema-snapshot.mjs --write` and commit `drizzle/schema-snapshot.sql` so future drift reports stay meaningful.
