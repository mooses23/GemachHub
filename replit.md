# Baby Banz Earmuffs Gemach

## Overview

This full-stack web application manages a global network of gemachs (lending libraries) for Baby Banz noise-cancelling earmuffs. Its primary purpose is to protect infants' hearing by facilitating the lending process, managing deposits, and providing administrative tools. The platform supports three user types: public users (borrowers, new gemach applicants), operators (manage specific gemach locations), and admins (system-wide oversight). The project aims to expand the availability of ear protection for infants worldwide by streamlining the lending and management process.
