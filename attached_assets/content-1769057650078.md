# TypeScript Execute ( _tsx_) [​](https://tsx.is/\#typescript-execute-tsx)

_tsx_ stands for _TypeScript Execute_ and it's a Node.js enhancement to run [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

For starters, think of `tsx` as an alias to `node` and use it the same way:

sh

```
node file.js
```

→↓

sh

```
tsx file.ts
```

You can pass in Node CLI flags and JS files too:

sh

```
tsx --env-file=.env ./file.js
```

## Features [​](https://tsx.is/\#features)

### Seamless TypeScript execution [​](https://tsx.is/\#seamless-typescript-execution)

Run TypeScript code without worrying about configuration!

_tsx_ runs your TypeScript code with modern and sensible defaults, making it user-friendly and especially great for beginners.

### Seamless CJS ↔ ESM imports [​](https://tsx.is/\#seamless-cjs-%E2%86%94-esm-imports)

No need to wonder whether a package is CommonJS or ESM again.

If you've encountered the `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` error in Node, you'll never see it again!

### Watch mode [​](https://tsx.is/\#watch-mode)

As a DX bonus, _tsx_ comes with [Watch mode](https://tsx.is/watch-mode) to re-run your files whenever you save them.

Iterate on your code faster and boost productivity!

## About the project [​](https://tsx.is/\#about-the-project)

The idea for _tsx_ came about during a time when the Node.js ecosystem was getting fragmented due to the release of [ES Modules (ESM)](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html). As packages migrated to ESM, projects struggled to reconcile their CommonJS apps with ESM dependencies.

Back then, _ts-node_ was the go-to tool for running TypeScript in Node.js, but it lacked ESM support and was quite complicated to use. We noticed several open-source tools using esbuild to run TypeScript in Node.js and decided to bring these efforts together into one simple, cohesive project.

**_tsx_ is designed to simplify your TypeScript experience.** It enhances Node.js with TypeScript support in both CommonJS and ESM modes, allowing you to switch between them seamlessly. It also supports `tsconfig.json` paths and includes a Watch mode to make development even easier.

Right now, the _tsx_ project development relies on user donations, which isn't sustainable in the long run. To keep _tsx_ reliable and growing, we need funding to cover maintenance and development costs.

If your company uses _tsx_ and would like to support the project, consider [sponsoring us](https://github.com/sponsors/privatenumber/sponsorships?pay_prorated=false&tier_id=388346)—in return we'll put up your logo + link!
